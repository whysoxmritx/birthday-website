      <h3>To Hemendra,<br></h3>
      <p>Iâ€™m sorry for letting my anger take overâ€”itâ€™s my biggest enemy.<br> I was anxious and insecure, just needing your reassurance, but when you got busy and involved Kritika, my overthinking spiraled.<br> I hate that instead of giving me assurance, it put me in this situation.<br><strong>There's much to this and we can talk things out if you want.</strong></p>
